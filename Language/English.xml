  <entityname.armored_hardsuit_bw>X01 Battle Armor</entityname.armored_hardsuit_bw>
  <entitydescription.armored_hardsuit_bw>A heavy suit of modern battle armor that offers great protection without hampering mobility. It has an attached universal holster to hold one weapon. It is the main issued suit to Iron Riders who don't need specialized protection. Requires an X01 Oxygen Cell for optimal performance.</entitydescription.armored_hardsuit_bw>
  <entityname.oxygen_cell_bw>X01 Power Cell</entityname.oxygen_cell_bw>
  <entitydescription.oxygen_cell_bw>The mainstay of Iron League technology is the X01 Oxygen Cell. It utilizes a mix of high-capacity fulgurium batteries with a cutting edge oxygen and pressure system using oxygenite forming a Powercell able power battle armor while also providing breathable air to the occupants. While they've been designed to be quite resistant to puncture and heat, they're certainly not invulnerable.</entitydescription.oxygen_cell_bw>

  <entityname.armored_hardsuit_bwl>X01 Commander Armor</entityname.armored_hardsuit_bwl>
  <entitydescription.armored_hardsuit_bwl>An adorned suit of armor for squad commanders and other veteran officers, the X01 Commander Armor is largely the same as the standard X01 Battle Armor, except that this suit possesses improved communication and sensor system to aid in squad navigation and target tracking. It also serves to serve as a subtle training method for newer Iron Riders, as losing contact with the squad commander usually leads to immediate disorientation.</entitydescription.armored_hardsuit_bwl>
  <entityname.armored_hardsuit_bw2>X01 Veteran Armor</entityname.armored_hardsuit_bw2>
  <entitydescription.armored_hardsuit_bw2>A highly adorned and venerated suit of Battle Armor. Each suit of veteran armor is personalized to the wearer through trinkets, engravings, and personal upgrades. It is slightly more robust than standard battle armor through small upgrades, though these small tweaks don't amount to much. The key difference that this suit possesses over others is its built thermal vision.</entitydescription.armored_hardsuit_bw2>
  <entityname.knight_hardsuit_bw>Silver Knight</entityname.knight_hardsuit_bw>
  <entitydescription.knight_hardsuit_bw>A mysterious suit of poorly understood armor that was put together in secret by rogue Iron League scientists using poorly understood alien materials found within the alien ruins. It feels almost alive at first touch. Linking deeply to the wearers body while worn, the suit seems to allow for some light resistance to the various toxins and parasites found hidden in the deep of Europa's waters. It requies a rare power cell made from alien power cells and other exotic materials to run properly. Don't let the battery run dry...</entitydescription.knight_hardsuit_bw>
  <entityname.pio_bw>Pioneer Custom</entityname.pio_bw>
  <entitydescription.pio_bw>While the Pioneer is an excellent suit of armor for those tasked jobs in dangerous regions of Europa and active combat zones the standart pioneer suit featured not enough armor. Due to frequent complaints and casualties among those the creation of the Pioneer Custom suit of armor was ordered which incorporates extra protection against the dangers of Combat but has become more bulky and less agile because of it. Made to run off of Oxygen Tanks albeit not very efficiently.</entitydescription.pio_bw>
  <entityname.pio_bw2>Pioneer</entityname.pio_bw2>
  <entitydescription.pio_bw2>The Pioneer series of Armor suits was designed to help Iron League engineers with their various tasks on Europa. Unlike most Iron League suits, its systems help with more efficient repair, maintenance and construction of bases and submarines while also offering better protection from the dangers associated with those tasks than normal diving suits and even allows the use of the same Oxygen Tanks.</entitydescription.pio_bw2>
  <entityname.armored_miningsuit_bw2>Hercules</entityname.armored_miningsuit_bw2>
  <entitydescription.armored_miningsuit_bw2>The Hercules is designed to work as a heavy weapons platform. To this extent it is heavy, slow, and incredibly protective. However, the armor is incredibly clausterphobic and its poor mobility is hampered even further by water. However, it's bulk does serve to absorb the recoil of even the heaviest Iron League weapons. The Hercules comes with a small crane arm and a small amount of armored internal storage to assist with ammunition management. Requies an X01 Oxygen Cell for optimal performance.</entitydescription.armored_miningsuit_bw2>
  <entityname.corsairar_bp>X00 Prototype Armor</entityname.corsairar_bp>
  <entitydescription.corsairar_bp>Experimental prototype with extremely high attack performance.Use X01 oxygen cell.</entitydescription.corsairar_bp>
  <entityname.armored_miningsuit_bw3>Hercules Mk.II</entityname.armored_miningsuit_bw3>
  <entitydescription.armored_miningsuit_bw3>The Hercules is an excellent weapon platform, but the sluggish nature of the armor meant that anyone who wielded it was often simply outmaneuvered by lighter forces. Thus a new iteration on the armor was developed, removing all of the intneral ammo storage and loading assistance in exchange for a more powerful movement system. It's still incredibly slow, but you will at least be able to reach the end of the hallway before the day is done. Requires an X01 Oxygen Cell for optimal performance.</entitydescription.armored_miningsuit_bw3>
